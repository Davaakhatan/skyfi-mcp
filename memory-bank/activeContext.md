# Active Context: SkyFi MCP

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Planning & Documentation  
**Status**: Initial Setup  
**Date**: January 2025

### Current Activities
1. **PRD Creation**: Product Requirements Document completed
2. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up project documentation structure
3. **Planning**: Defining technical architecture and implementation approach

## Recent Changes

### January 2025
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD document
- ✅ Initialized memory bank structure
- ✅ Defined project scope and requirements
- ✅ Established success metrics and KPIs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. **Technical Architecture Design**
   - Define detailed system architecture
   - Choose implementation technology stack
   - Design API specifications
   - Plan database schema

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Initialize code repository
   - Setup development environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Establish coding standards

3. **SkyFi API Analysis**
   - Review SkyFi Public API documentation
   - Identify required endpoints
   - Understand authentication mechanisms
   - Map API capabilities to requirements

### Short-term (Next Month)
1. **Phase 1: Foundation Implementation**
   - Core MCP server implementation
   - Basic API integration with SkyFi
   - Authentication and credential management
   - Initial documentation structure

2. **Prototype Development**
   - Build minimal viable server
   - Test with sample AI agents
   - Validate architecture decisions
   - Gather early feedback

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. **Phase 2: Core Features**
   - Order placement with price confirmation
   - Feasibility checking
   - Data search and exploration
   - OpenStreetMaps integration

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Programming Language**
   - Consideration: Python vs. Node.js vs. Go
   - Factors: Framework support, developer experience, performance
   - Decision needed: Before Phase 1 starts

2. **Database Choice**
   - Consideration: PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB vs. Redis
   - Factors: Data structure, query patterns, scalability
   - Decision needed: Before Phase 1 starts

3. **Framework Integration Priority**
   - Consideration: Which framework to support first (ADK, LangChain, AI SDK)
   - Factors: Market demand, complexity, community size
   - Decision needed: Before Phase 1 starts

### Design Decisions Pending
1. **API Design**
   - RESTful vs. GraphQL
   - Endpoint structure
   - Error response format
   - Versioning strategy

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - API key management
   - OAuth 2.0 implementation
   - Token refresh mechanisms
   - Multi-user credential handling

3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Documentation platform choice
   - Example code organization
   - Framework-specific guides structure

## Current Blockers & Risks

### Blockers
- None currently identified

### Risks Being Monitored
1. **SkyFi API Stability**
   - Risk: API changes during development
   - Mitigation: Version API, maintain backward compatibility
   - Status: Monitoring

2. **Framework Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Integration may be more complex than expected
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping, community feedback
   - Status: To be validated in Phase 1

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Risk: May struggle to meet < 500ms response time
   - Mitigation: Load testing, caching strategy, optimization
   - Status: To be tested in Phase 1

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. **Technology Stack**
   - What programming language and framework?
   - What database technology?
   - What deployment platform?

2. **SkyFi API Access**
   - Do we have full API documentation?
   - Are test credentials available?
   - What are rate limits and quotas?

3. **Integration Priorities**
   - Which AI framework to prioritize?
   - What features are most critical for MVP?
   - What's the minimum viable feature set?

4. **Documentation Strategy**
   - What documentation platform to use?
   - How to structure framework-specific guides?
   - What examples are most valuable?

## Active Stakeholders

- **Product Team**: Defining requirements and priorities
- **Engineering Team**: (To be assigned) Technical implementation
- **Design Team**: (To be assigned) User experience design
- **SkyFi API Team**: Providing API access and documentation

## Communication Channels

- **Project Repository**: (To be created)
- **Documentation**: Memory bank and PRD
- **Meetings**: (To be scheduled) Regular sync meetings

## Notes & Observations

- PRD is comprehensive and well-defined
- Clear success metrics established
- Strong focus on developer experience
- Need to validate technical assumptions early
- Open-source demo agent is key differentiator
