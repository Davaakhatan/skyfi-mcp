- **Price Clarity**: Clear pricing information before order placement
- **Order Visibility**: Full order tracking and status updates
- **Self-Service**: Complete orders without technical assistance

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flows

#### 1. Developer Integration Flow
```
Discover → Review Docs → Get Credentials → Deploy Server → Test → Integrate
```
- Developer discovers SkyFi MCP through documentation or community
- Reviews framework-specific integration guides
- Obtains API credentials from SkyFi
- Deploys MCP server (local Docker or cloud)
- Tests with sample queries
- Integrates with their AI agent

#### 2. Data Discovery & Ordering Flow
```
Search → Refine → Review → Check Pricing → Confirm → Order → Monitor
```
- AI agent initiates data search with natural language
- Iteratively refines search criteria based on results
- Reviews available data options with metadata
- Checks pricing and feasibility
- Confirms order details
- Places order with price confirmation
- Monitors order status

#### 3. Monitoring Setup Flow
```
Define AOI → Configure Parameters → Setup Webhook → Activate → Receive Updates
```
- User defines Area of Interest (AOI) programmatically
- Configures monitoring parameters (frequency, triggers)
- Sets up webhook endpoints for notifications
- Activates monitoring
- Receives real-time notifications for data updates
